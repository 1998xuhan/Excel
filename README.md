🍽️ Restaurant Sales Data Analysis

This project explores a restaurant sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The analysis demonstrates how to clean, transform, and visualise data to uncover meaningful insights.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:


✂️ Trimmed white spaces from text fields.
🔢 Rounded quantities to the nearest whole number.

🌍 Created a Country column based on city values.

🗑 Removed duplicates (5 records identified and deleted).

📊 Box & Whiskers plot used to detect outliers (could not identify them visually).

🕵️ Manager-level outlier check: one manager showed consistent price outliers → may suggest incorrect data entry.

💰 Created a Revenue column = Price × Quantity.

📈 Exploratory Analysis with Pivot Tables

Using pivot tables, the following business questions were answered:

⭐ What is the best-selling product?

💰 What is the total revenue by product?

🌎 What is the revenue breakdown for products by countries?

📊 Key Takeaways

Outliers highlight potential data quality issues with certain managers.

Top products and country-level splits provide actionable sales insights.

Pivot tables make it easy to slice data by product, country, and manager for decision-making.
